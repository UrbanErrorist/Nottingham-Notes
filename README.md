# Nottingham Notes

[We all have hundreds of fleeting thoughts throughout the day, and the ability to capture and coalesce those ideas is critical to many of our workflows. Yet thereâ€™s no easy way to snapshot thoughts as we have them â€“ and that's why we created Nottingham Note.

Nottingham is a clean, minimalist, note-taking application that can push your thoughts to email.

### Use the Notes app

- Unlock phone
- Launch the notes app
- Navigate to the list of notes
- Tap the `+` button

And end up forgetting to read the note when you're back home

### Send an email to yourself

- Unlock phone
- Launch the mail app
- Enter your email address
- Add a subject (or not and get the extra alert to confirm)
- Type in what you want to remember
- Hit the send button
